# Face Shape Key Preset Distribution Guide

These are the distribution rules for face presets created with M. Avatar Setting.

## Basic Distribution Rules

When distributing (selling or giving away for free) presets, please follow these rules.

1.  **What You Can Distribute**
    Only the **.asset files** located in `Assets/emudotto/Menno/Resources/Face_Presets/`.

2.  **What You Cannot Distribute**
    Distributing any data other than the preset file, such as the Menno avatar's model data (.fbx) or textures, is **strictly prohibited**.

3.  **Selling is OK**
    You can freely distribute and sell the presets you create, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. It is recommended to distribute them in UnityPackage format for user convenience.

4.  **Mandatory Requirement for Users**
    When selling or distributing presets, you must require that **the user has already purchased the main Menno avatar body**. Please be sure to include the following information in the description of your distribution page.

    > **[Required Information]**
    > This data is a preset exclusively for #Menno3D.
    > The main Menno avatar body, sold separately, is required for use.

5.  **Use at Your Own Risk**
    The use of distributed presets is at your own risk. The creator and emudotto are not responsible for any problems that may arise from the use of the presets.
