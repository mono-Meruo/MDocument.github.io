![Preset Feature UI]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/preset_ui.png)

## Preset System Overview

The facial preset feature is a system for saving and managing Menno avatar's face blend shape settings.

### Key Features

- **Non-destructive Editing**: Applying presets doesn't completely overwrite current settings, you can adjust the intensity
- **Layer Blending**: Apply multiple presets simultaneously to create complex expressions
- **Real-time Preview**: See changes immediately
- **Project Sharing**: Copy preset files to use in other projects

## Preset Data Structure

### Saved Data

Presets save the following information:

1. **Preset Name**: User-defined identifier
2. **Blend Shape Values**: Each blend shape value (0.0 to 1.0)
3. **Creation Date**: When the preset was created

### File Format

Presets are saved as `.asset` files.

### Save Location

Preset files are saved in the following directory:
```
Assets/emudotto/Menno/Resources/Face_Presets/
```

## Advanced Usage

### Preset Blending

How values are calculated when applying multiple presets:

1. **Additive Blending**: Values from each preset are added
   - Example: Preset A (smile: 0.5) + Preset B (smile: 0.3) = smile: 0.8

2. **Maximum Value Limit**: Blend shape values do not exceed 1.0
   - Example: 0.7 + 0.6 = 1.0 (not 1.3)

### Preset Priority

- Later applied presets take priority
- Presets with 0% intensity are ignored
- Real-time changed values have highest priority

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Presets Not Saving
- **Cause**: No file write permissions
- **Solution**: Check Unity project folder permissions

#### Presets Not Applying
- **Cause**: Blend shape names have changed
- **Solution**: Recreate the preset or manually edit the .asset file

#### Preset Intensity Not Working
- **Cause**: Other scripts are controlling blend shapes
- **Solution**: Disable conflicting scripts or adjust execution order

## Sharing Presets

### Export Method

1. Open the `Face_Presets` folder in the Project window
2. Select the preset files you want to share
3. Right-click and select "Export Package"

### Import Method

1. Drag and drop the received preset files into your project
2. Place in the `Face_Presets` folder (if the export folder was "Face_Presets", it will be automatically placed on import)
3. Reopen the M. Avatar Setting window
