### 2. Enter Preset Name
In the "Shape Key Preset" section, enter a preset name.
- By default, a name like `Menno_Face_Preset_01` is automatically entered
- You can change it to a more descriptive name (e.g., "Child", "Adult", "Baby Face", etc.)

### 3. Click Save Button
Click the "Save" button to save the current blend shape settings as a preset.

## How to Use Presets

### 1. Select from Saved Presets
Your saved presets are displayed in the "Saved Presets" section.

### 2. Apply with Intensity Slider
Each preset has an "Intensity" slider:
- **0%**: Do not apply preset
- **50%**: Apply preset at half intensity
- **100%**: Fully apply preset

### 3. Real-time Preview
Moving the slider changes the blend shapes in real-time.

## Convenient Features

### Preset Blending
You can apply multiple presets simultaneously to create new blend shapes.
- Example: Apply "Child" at 50% and "Adult" at 30% to create your preferred blend shape settings.
